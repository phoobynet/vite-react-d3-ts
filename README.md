# Vite, React, D3 and Tailwind

```bash
gh repo create my-d3-react-app --template phoobynet/vite-react-d3-tw --private --clone
```

# Vite

Basic configuration, but with alias for the `src` directory as `@`.

# TypeScript

Yep.

# ESLint

Also, yep, but with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), and using the [JavaScript "standard"](https://standardjs.com/).

# Lint Staged

- [Prettier Pre-commit Hook](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html)
- [GitHub - Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)

# Themes

Powered by [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). To change the theme simply change the `html.class` attribute to one of the available themes found [here](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/)

# D3

Everything is installed.

- [D3 Official Documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki)
- [D3 in Depth](https://www.d3indepth.com/introduction/)
- [D3 for the Impatient](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/d3-for-the/9781492046783/) - slightly out of date, but good for anybody who knows JS/TS, CSS and HTML and just wants to get straight to the meat.
